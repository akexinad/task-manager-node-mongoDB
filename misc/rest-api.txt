REST = Representational State Transfer
API = Application Programming Interface

- Shortened to REST API or RESTful API

- AN API IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SET OF TOOLS THAT ALLOW TO BUILD SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.
  - Ex. Node provides us with API's
  - Ex. Express.js provides us with API's

- THE REST API ALLOWS CLIENTS SUCH AS A WEB APP TO ACCES AND MANIPULATE RESOURCES USING A SET OF PREDEFINED OPERATIONS
  - In this instance, RESOURCE is something like a user or tasks.
  - A PREDEFINED OPERATIONS is something like creating a new user or new task.

- The REST API works with REPRESENTATION of our data [users and tasks] where we can perform the basic CRUD operations.


THE TASK RESOURCE

C  Create   =>  POST     /tasks
   --------------------------------
R  Read     =>  GET      /tasks
   Read     =>  GET      /tasks/:id
   --------------------------------
U  Update   =>  PATCH    /tasks/:id
   --------------------------------
D  Delete   =>  DELETE   /tasks/:id
